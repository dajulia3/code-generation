code-generation
===============

Code generation excercise. Generates Java Byte code for the decaffeinated java language. Scanner (lexical analyzer) was generated using JFLEX. Parser/Grammar was written using CUP (which was used to generate an AST in Java). I wrote a VERY complete test harness for this project and used a TDD approach. I didn't use mock objects or anything to stub out dependencies in the tests, but they were all still EXTREMELY helpful. Apparently this final project was one of the few that actually didn't crash, and one of even fewer that generated correct output.
